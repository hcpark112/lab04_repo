Joe Murray 
<br/>
Has a very busy schedule that changes often<br/>
Enjoys watching sports<br/>
Played recreationally when he was young<br/>
Doesn’t want to be committed to a sports team<br/>
Can’t find people his age to play with<br/>
Can’t keep up with newer generations<br/>
To play sports like he used to when he was young<br/>
To play with people his age<br/>
Become active again<br/>
To find a system that works around his schedule<br/>
